MDPRF69504,25,Male,Cisgender,4,1,17,In the first task during the waiting periods and selecting the choices I was really taking the time to reflect on myself. Ofcourse the questions asked prior to the task effected this but event hough the waiting times were short I done a lot of self reflection on myself and I also asked myself why I was selecting the choices the way I was.,It felt slower as time went on. I think that shows that doing something which is repetitive makes time feel slower and causes a human to become more bored.,I think the most Frustrated i was during the task was selecting the longer rest period of 6 minutes.

As time passed, I felt my patience wearing thin, and what should have been a brief pause turned into a frustrating and tedious experience. I couldn’t help but feel restless, grappling with the boredom and annoyance of having nothing to occupy my mind. Each minute seemed to stretch out, making the wait feel even longer than it actually was.","Every passing moment felt even slower than the last, amplifying my sense of restlessness. It was as if time itself had decided to drag on, turning the wait into an endless stretch of tedium. Each tick of the clock only heightened my frustration, leaving me increasingly aware of how little I had to occupy my thoughts. The boredom became palpable, making it hard to stay still and focused.","During the rest periods, I often experienced feelings of unhappiness, frustration, and boredom, especially when I had nothing to engage my mind. It was particularly challenging when I was waiting in a crowded space, surrounded by others who seemed absorbed in their activities. I felt isolated in my own restlessness, watching the minutes drag by with little to distract me.

The frustration grew when I realized how much I wanted to be productive or engaged, yet I was stuck in a situation that felt completely unchangeable. Moments like these made it hard to remain patient, as my mind raced with thoughts of everything I could be doing instead. This sense of lost time contributed to my unhappiness, turning what could have been a peaceful break into a source of irritation."

However, by the second task I was used to the 6 minute rest, and the fact that the alternative was the same duration of time made it slightly more bearable.","The 6 minutes in the first rest period felt much longer than the second one, since it was my first time doing it and because it could have been much shorter. The second 6 minutes therefore felt a bit shorter",I felt frustrated by the mundane task of staring at a screen - I am used to keeping busy when on my laptop and also in day to day life so this task felt boring to me.

However, I think as the first 6 minutes progressed I started feeling more irritable and bored, and then my happiness started decreasing as a result. I was thinking primarily about myself and I think that contributed to the early negativity and increased boredom. When the second 6 minutes came on I found myself getting increasingly less irritated and more calm and relaxed, albeit still feeling quite bored and unstimulated. The negative thoughts about myself seemed to plateau and I returned to quite a neutral state throughout the second 6 minute set.","The first 6 minutes definitely felt faster than the second 6 minutes, I think as there was two progress bars of differing speeds initially, then two of the same time schedule. This made the second 6 minutes seem a lot longer, whereas I felt the first 6 minutes was pretty standard, albeit with a faster beginning.","Increased irritation and boredom as the first set progressed, and I don't feel the boredom ever majorly subsided, though it dwindle throughout the second set.

MDPRF61006,25,Female,Cisgender,3,0,10,I found myself getting more frustrated in the second round knowing that if I pressed the right key then it would have taken 5 minutes less time. I also wondered if the first round was a deliberate no difference in time to act as a baseline.,Perhaps the second round felt slightly longer but I think this was because I had already done it once and knew it could have been much shorter.,"Slight frustration and boredom knowing it could have been faster. There was also not so much going on, hence the slight boredom."

Only to find out that they were both 6 minutes again, then frustration.","Slower, I hate that each rest period was 30 seconds that's part of why I was getting frustrated. If it was every minute sure, but every 30 seconds got on my nerves. I had to keep moving in my chair out of boredom.","Main reason was the 30 second questionare.

MDPRF73219,23,Male,Cisgender,0,0,8,"I felt really bored after the second stint of rests. I think this was mainly due to the fact I sat through 6 minutes on the first rest as well. I was a bit annoyed when both of the second boxes had 6 minutes, but I sort of laughed it off but was still frustrated and unhappy that I had to sit through another 6 minutes.","I think it felt faster than I expected. I think the fact that the gaps are 30 seconds long (they were on the first one so not sure if they were on the second rest) helps to make it feel faster. I did also feel that the first few minutes were slower, but I think that's just because I see the progress bar barely full and think ""I've got to sit through another X minutes of this"".","I felt bored as the rest periods went on. I think this is just because doing this sort of stuff (sitting still and focusing on a screen with no interaction) makes me a bit restless. I was certainly frustrated on the second rest period to find out I had picked 6 minutes twice and I think that feeling only got worse throughout. I was a bit unhappy throughout, bit I think that just reflects my general mood today. I did feel a bit happy throughout the first period but this was just accepted I was here for the long haul and laughed it off."
